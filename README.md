# Used-Cars-Prediction-Linear-regression

This report will analyze the attributes of the Used Cars dataset:

The goal of this report is to gather useful statistics and information regarding the cars and predict the best selling price for it based on a number of predictors. We analyzed the dataset Vehicle dataset from cardekho | Kaggle published on the website Kaggle.

After the initial data pre-processing we are using a linear regression model to fit the observations and give us an insight on the important predictors that are contributing to a better price estimation. We are also validating the model assumptions and validating the predictor variables and observations to remove any discrepancies that may affect our model and add bias to our predictions.
